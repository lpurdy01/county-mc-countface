# county-mc-countface
This is mostly a scratch repo to try and count some stuff in pictures. 

# Development Env
Developed using Pycharm on Windows 11. Python 3.11

Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Project state
Currently, image_processing.py is the only thing that does stuff. 
If running it outside pycharm pro with the sci view plugin enabled you will need to comment out the `plt.show()` line 
for any graphs you don't want to see.
